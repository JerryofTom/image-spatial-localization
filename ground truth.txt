1.Ground Truth of the Fixed Point  in Scenario 1:
   longitude: 103.9868656
   latitude: 30.62812318


2.Ground Truth Line in Scenario 2:
   Top point)
   longitude: 103.9871481
   latitude: 30.62829454
   Intermediate point)
   longitude: 103.9871639
   latitude: 30.62823419
   Bottom point)
   longitude: 103.9866875
   latitude: 30.62801638
   The ground truth line is acquired by connecting top point with intermediate point and connecting intermediate point with bottom point.
